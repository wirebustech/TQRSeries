            <p>The Qualitative Research Series (TQRS) offers a variety of free online learning opportunities designed to make qualitative research accessible, practical, and engaging for all. Our sessions are tailored to support students and researchers at different stages of their careers, with a special focus on those in the Global South.</p>
            <h4 class="mt-5 mb-3">Types of Sessions</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Webinars:</strong> Live lectures led by experienced researchers, followed by interactive question-and-answer sessions. Webinars provide foundational knowledge and the latest insights in qualitative research.</li>
                <li><strong>Hands-on Training:</strong> Practical sessions where participants actively engage in research tasks, data analysis, and methodological exercises. These sessions are designed to build confidence and competence in real-world research scenarios.</li>
                <li><strong>Interactive Workshops:</strong> Collaborative workshops that encourage peer learning, group discussions, and problem-solving. Participants work together on case studies, share experiences, and develop new skills in a supportive environment.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4 class="mt-5 mb-3">Our Learning Approach</h4>
            <p>TQRS is committed to fostering an inclusive and interactive learning space. All sessions are designed to be accessible, with opportunities for participants to ask questions, share challenges, and receive feedback from experts and peers. We believe that learning is most effective when it is collaborative, practical, and directly relevant to participants' research needs.</p>
